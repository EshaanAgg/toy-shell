This is my Rust solution to the ["Build Your Own Shell" Challenge](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/shell/overview) by Codecrafters. 

In this challenge I aim to build a functioning Unix shell from scratch, which supports:
- Basic commands like `ECHO`, `TYPE`, `EXIT`
- Navigation of the file system with `PWD` and `CD`
- Executing programs with arguments
